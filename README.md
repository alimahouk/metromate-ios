# MetroMate

MetroMate was a beautifully-designed, interactive guide to the Dubai Metro. It
pioneered new features that later made their way into the Dubai Road & Transport Authority's official apps.

Despite there being no publicly-accessible source of train timings, it was accomplished through some clever observation, math, & programming. MetroMate landed me my first news appearance on national television.
